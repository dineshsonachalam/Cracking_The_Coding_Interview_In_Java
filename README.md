# Tips for cracking coding Interview
Focus on following areas to crack almost any programming interview:

#### Data structures: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Hash Table, BST, Map (Hash vs Tree), Set, Trie, Graph. Applications and pros & cons of those.

#### Algorithms: Time complexity, Space complexity, Sorting, Searching, BFS & DFS, Dynamic programming, Recursion, Bit manipulations.

#### Maths: Permutations, Combinations, Medians, Probability, Geometry, …

#### Problem solving: How to reduce any given problem to a known Math or DS or DS+algo problem given enough hints.

#### Coding: Write elegant, correct and efficient code in 25–45 minutes.

#### Tips for coding interviews:

Ask relevant questions before attempting to solve
break the problem into similar/smaller known problems
briefly discuss brute force approach, if required
where applicable, use
1. maths
2. sorting
3. searching
4. traversal
5. recursion
6. bit manipulation
7. dynamic programming
8. before implementing your algorithm
9. discuss it with the interviewer
10. discuss it’s time and space complexity
#### See if it can be improved based on above discussion
write test cases (before code!)
start small, test immediately
write functions that are
reusable
loosely coupled
small and do only one thing!
avoid
gotos
unnecessary variables
unnecessary/many/nested if-elses
always
validate input
check return codes
handle corner cases
trace your code with test cases before telling the interviewer - done!

# Challenge
Life is a challenge. Inorder to accomplish anything great remember for. You need 3 things HARD WORK + BLOOD + PERSEVERANCE = UNSTOPPABLE. I challenge myself, I will push my local directory into my github. If I had completed 100% of a particular topic.
