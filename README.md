#### Algorithm: method for solving a problem.
#### Data structure: method to store information.
#### Datastructure classified into 2 types
 1. Linear : A data structure is said to be linear if the elements form a sequence, for example Array, Linked list, queue etc
 2. Non Linear :  A data item is connected to several other data items. So that a given data item has the possibility to reach one-or-more data items, for example trees and graphs

# Tips for cracking coding Interview
Focus on following areas to crack almost any programming interview:

#### Data structures: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Hash Table, BST, Map (Hash vs Tree), Set, Trie, Graph. Applications and pros & cons of those.

#### Algorithms: Time complexity, Space complexity, Sorting, Searching, BFS & DFS, Dynamic programming, Recursion, Bit manipulations.

#### Maths: Permutations, Combinations, Medians, Probability, Geometry, …

#### Problem solving: How to reduce any given problem to a known Math or DS or DS+algo problem given enough hints.

#### Coding: Write elegant, correct and efficient code in 25–45 minutes.

#### Tips for coding interviews:

Ask relevant questions before attempting to solve
break the problem into similar/smaller known problems
briefly discuss brute force approach, if required
where applicable, use
1. maths
2. sorting
3. searching
4. traversal
5. recursion
6. bit manipulation
7. dynamic programming
8. before implementing your algorithm
9. discuss it with the interviewer
10. discuss it’s time and space complexity
#### See if it can be improved based on above discussion
write test cases (before code!)
start small, test immediately
write functions that are
reusable
loosely coupled
small and do only one thing!
avoid
gotos
unnecessary variables
unnecessary/many/nested if-elses
always
validate input
check return codes
handle corner cases
trace your code with test cases before telling the interviewer - done!

# Challenge
Life is a challenge. Inorder to accomplish anything great remembered for. You need 3 things HARD WORK + BLOOD + PERSEVERANCE = UNSTOPPABLE. I challenge myself, I will push my local directory into my github. If I had completed 100% of a particular topic.
# Whats important ?
Most important part of this repository is to show that I want to make it successful and working prototype inorder to help anyone to reach their goals in the field of competitive programming and helping them to crack their interviews. So go Rise and Shine. Work your Ass off ! I dont want to be an average guy for rest of my life. I want to be someone worth remebered for the work I do. I want to live upto my potential. I dont want someone to judge me about my capabilities and what I can do with my life. So now the most important part YOU DO IT WHEN ODDS ARE NOT IN YOUR TURN AS ELON MUSK DID! 
# Inspiration and my motivation
- [What is the secret of self discipline By Ara-Mambreyan](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-self-discipline/answer/Ara-Mambreyan-1)
- [What do you do when no one believes in you? By Ara-Mambreyan](https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-do-when-no-one-believes-in-you/answer/Ara-Mambreyan-1?srid=RzIL)
##### Nobody believes in nobody. You are the only one who knows yourself. YOU!

##### Not me. Not your teacher. Not your girlfriend. Not even your parents.

##### YOU! You are the freak of nature. You have the power within you. Nobody, knows how you think or how much power of will you have. Only you!

##### Find the burning power within you. Self-confidence (which leads to hard-work) is the leading factor of success. Talent, brain and discipline are nothing if you don’t have self-confidence. But don’t tie your self-confidence with what others believe.

##### Believe in yourself and go conquer the world!
##### When something is difficult, I have to push myself in doing that. The first days would be hard and tedious. Then, it would become a habit. Lastly, it would become a lifestyle.
# Making Execuses?
See Ara Mambreyan just a 16 year old guy cracked the international olympiad . Do not waste time partying/socializing.

This is me in the August with the current President of Armenia.

Your family and friends doesnt give a damn about your dreams. Dont ever get a opinion from them. Stop advicing people and friends until you achieve anything great because 'Your words dont create Monuments but your Action does!'. Live your dream. Follow your instincts! Live life to your potential and then life becomes a celebration !
